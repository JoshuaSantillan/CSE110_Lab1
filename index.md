## Hello, my name is [*Josh*](#Josh's) I'm *24* and major in *Computer Science* at *UCSD* you are reading from [this current file](index.md).

# About Me
## Myself as a person:
### A few of my Hobbies:

1. Playing Video Games
  - World of Warcraft
  - League of Legends
  - Legend of Zelda
  - Super Smash Bros
  - Street Fighter
2. Weight Lifting and HIIT

4. Calculus

## Myself as a Programmer
1. My go to langauge is CPP but I know others such as:
  - JavaScript
  - Python
  - Java
  - Lua
  - C
  - Arduino
 2. I love front-end programming because I'm a visual learner, but I find more back-end more fascinating
 3. I love problem solving and approaching problems from different angles
 4. My favorite topic in Computer Science is Computer Networking, I grew up online so I am fascinating on how the web brings people from all over the world together.
 5. I have a strong background in Computer IT/Administration. 
 6. I have been teaching myself react and have published a personal project [here](https://joshuasantillan.github.io/Monsters_Rolodex_React/). 
My favorite piece of code from this project was this search component:
```jsx
export const SearchBox = ({placeholder,handleChange}) => (
    <input 
    className = 'search'
    type ='search' 
    placeholder = {placeholder} // make it dynamic
    //  can console .log a second param below because  second agument to call state right away since it is asyncronous <--- spelling?
    onChange = {handleChange}
/>
```

The goals I've made and accomplished so far in life are:
- [x] ~~Graduate High School~~
- [x] ~~Graduate With my AS Degree~~
- [x] ~~Transfer to a 4 year university~~
- [ ] Graduate with honors
- [ ] Get an internship
- [x] ~~Get involved in research~~
- [x] ~~Meet new friends~~
- [x] ~~Take a software engineering class~~

So far, my favorite thing from week one is the lecture slide that states:
> Attitude First: You must want to be a better programmer
